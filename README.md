# jQuery To-Do-List w/ SQL

_Duration: 2-day weekend challenge_

## Description

To-Do-List is an app that allows the user to create tasks, mark them as completed or not completed, and remove them from the list. All tasks are stored on a database until deleted by the user. Completed tasks will have a green background, and a yellow button to re-mark them as not complete.
