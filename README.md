# jQuery To-Do-List w/ SQL

_Duration: 2-day weekend challenge_

## Description

To-Do-List is an app that allows the user to create tasks, and remove them from the list. All tasks are stored on a database until deleted by the user. Completed tasks will be moved down into the completed section when marked complete.  You can also hit the undo button to bring that task back up into your to-do list.
